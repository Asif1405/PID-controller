# PID-controller

### Overview:
PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. These three components are combined in such a way that it produces a control signal. 
This is very basic controller in control theory and using proportional, integral, and derivative components using CTE to find out the control signal.

### Requirements:
- C++
